## Files


Scenario{SUFFIX}.py - These files contain the different implementations of the scenarios, simple, multi and rgb.

Makefile - Helps to build an executable that might take many commands to create.
log.txt - Git usage log
requirements.txt - Contains names of all packages that need to be installed once the virtual environment is created

## Usage

- Create the virtual environment by using the "make venv" command
- Install all required libraries by using the "make install" command
- Run program using the "python3 Scenario{SUFFIX}.py" where the suffix is the number of the scenario.

- Clean all generated files by using the "make clean" command

Code should run with no problems on nightmare. Happy Package Collecting :)
